# Backend Server URL (for local development)
# Leave empty in production - it will automatically use the same origin (GameBuddies reverse proxy)
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Base Path Configuration
# - Standalone Render deployment: Leave empty (defaults to '/')
# - GameBuddies reverse proxy: Set to '/thinkalike/'
# VITE_BASE_PATH=/thinkalike/

# Development Note:
# - Local dev: Set VITE_BACKEND_URL to http://localhost:3001
# - Production: Leave empty or unset - the app will use window.location.origin
# - This ensures compatibility with GameBuddies reverse proxy

# GameBuddies Integration
# NOTE: API key is NOT needed in client - server handles GameBuddies API calls
# The server has access to the API key via process.env.GAMEBUDDIES_API_KEY
# This keeps the API key secure and not exposed to the browser

# TURN Server Credentials (REQUIRED for mobile cellular networks)
# Mobile devices on 4G/5G cellular need TURN servers because carrier-grade NAT
# blocks direct peer-to-peer WebRTC connections. STUN servers only work on WiFi.
#
# Get free TURN credentials at: https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/
# Free tier: 500MB/month bandwidth, unlimited users, no credit card required
#
# Without TURN servers:
# ✅ Desktop-to-Desktop (WiFi): Will work
# ✅ Mobile-to-Desktop (WiFi): Will work
# ❌ Mobile-to-Desktop (4G/5G): Will FAIL
# ❌ iOS devices: May have issues
#
# With TURN servers:
# ✅ All connections work (Desktop, Mobile WiFi, Mobile Cellular, iOS)
