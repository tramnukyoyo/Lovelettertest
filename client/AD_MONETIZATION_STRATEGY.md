## Non-Intrusive Ads That Don't Annoy Players

**Last Updated:** November 6, 2025
**Alternative to:** Premium cosmetics (can be used together!)
**Goal:** Generate revenue without disrupting gameplay

---

## TL;DR - The Ad Strategy

### Revenue Potential
With **500 active daily users** and **2-3 ads per session:**
- **Conservative:** $150-400/month
- **Optimized:** $400-800/month
- **Best case:** $800-1500/month

### Key Principle
**Show ads ONLY at natural break points** - never during active gameplay.

---

## Part 1: Ad Revenue Math

### CPM Rates (2025 Gaming Industry)

**CPM = Cost Per Mille (per 1,000 impressions)**

| Ad Type | CPM Range | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Banner Ads** | $1-3 | Lobby screens |
| **Video Ads (skippable)** | $5-15 | Between rounds |
| **Rewarded Video** | $10-50 | Optional rewards |
| **Interstitial Ads** | $3-8 | Game transitions |
| **Native Ads** | $5-12 | In-content placements |

**Your Platform (Web-based):**
- Expected average CPM: **$3-8**
- Geography matters: US/EU = $8-15 CPM, Global average = $3-5 CPM

### Revenue Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Monthly Revenue = (Daily Active Users × Ads per Session × Days) × CPM / 1000
```

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Conservative (200 DAU)**
```
200 DAU × 2 ads/session × 30 days = 12,000 impressions/month
12,000 × $4 CPM / 1000 = $48/month per game
5 games × $48 = $240/month total
```

**Scenario 2: Growth (500 DAU)**
```
500 DAU × 3 ads/session × 30 days = 45,000 impressions/month
45,000 × $6 CPM / 1000 = $270/month per game
5 games × $270 = $1,350/month total
```

**Scenario 3: Viral (2000 DAU)**
```
2,000 DAU × 3 ads/session × 30 days = 180,000 impressions/month
180,000 × $8 CPM / 1000 = $1,440/month per game
5 games × $1,440 = $7,200/month total
```

### Revenue Split by Ad Type

**Typical mix for 3 ads per session:**
- 1 banner ad (lobby) = $2 CPM
- 1 interstitial (between rounds) = $6 CPM
- 1 optional rewarded video (bonus) = $15 CPM (only ~20% watch)

**Blended CPM: $5-7**

---

## Part 2: Non-Intrusive Ad Placement (The Golden Rules)

### Rule 1: Never Show Ads During Active Gameplay ❌

**BAD Examples:**
- ❌ Ad pops up mid-game
- ❌ Banner covers game controls
- ❌ Video plays while player is drawing/voting
- ❌ Forced full-screen ad between every action

**Why this kills your game:** Players quit immediately. Conversion drops to 0%.

### Rule 2: Show Ads at Natural Break Points ✅

**GOOD Examples:**
- ✅ After game ends (before returning to lobby)
- ✅ Between rounds (5-second skippable video)
- ✅ In lobby waiting for players
- ✅ Optional "watch ad for bonus" button
- ✅ On results/leaderboard screen

**Why this works:** Players expect a pause. Ads feel natural, not disruptive.

### Rule 3: Frequency Cap (Maximum Ads Per Session)

**Research shows:**
- **Casual games:** 4-6 ads/session acceptable
- **Midcore/Strategic:** 2-3 ads/session acceptable
- **Competitive/Ranked:** 1-2 ads/session acceptable

**Your Games:**
- **Party games (SUSD, DDF, BingoBuddies):** 3-4 ads/session ✅
- **Strategic (ClueScale, SchoolQuizGame):** 2-3 ads/session ✅

### Rule 4: Make Ads Skippable

**Best practice:**
- Video ads: 5-second skip button
- Banner ads: X button in corner
- Interstitial ads: "Continue" button after 3 seconds
- Rewarded ads: 100% optional

**Why:** Players feel in control. Reduces frustration dramatically.

## Part 3: Specific Ad Placement for Each Game

### SchoolQuizGame (Educational)

**Ad Type:** Minimal - educational context
**Frequency:** 2 ads per session

**Placement Strategy:**
1. **Banner Ad - Lobby (1 ad)**
   - Location: Bottom of screen while waiting for game to start
   - Size: 728×90 leaderboard banner (desktop) or 320×50 mobile
   - Shown: Only before game starts
   - Impact: Low - players are waiting anyway

2. **Interstitial Ad - After Game Ends (1 ad)**
   - Location: Full-screen between game end and lobby
   - Timing: 3-second countdown "Returning to lobby in 3...2...1..." + ad
   - Skippable: After 5 seconds
   - Impact: Low - natural transition

**Revenue (200 DAU):**
```
200 DAU × 2 ads × 30 days = 12,000 impressions
12,000 × $5 CPM / 1000 = $60/month
```

**Why minimal ads:** Educational games have lower tolerance. Teachers won't use if ads are disruptive.

---

### SUSD (Among Us-style)

**Ad Type:** Moderate - social game, casual audience
**Frequency:** 3 ads per session

**Placement Strategy:**
1. **Banner Ad - Lobby (1 ad)**
   - Location: Top or bottom of lobby screen
   - Shown: While waiting for players to join
   - Impact: Low - players chatting, waiting

2. **Interstitial Ad - Between Rounds (1 ad)**
   - Location: Full-screen after round results shown
   - Timing: After 5 seconds of results screen
   - Skippable: After 3-5 seconds
   - Impact: Medium - but natural break

3. **Optional Rewarded Video - Bonus Cosmetic (1 ad)**
   - Location: "Watch ad for free avatar" button in cosmetics menu
   - Reward: Unlock 1 random free cosmetic
   - Optional: 100% player choice
   - Impact: Zero (optional = no disruption)

**Revenue (500 DAU):**
```
500 DAU × 3 ads × 30 days = 45,000 impressions
Banner: 15,000 × $3 / 1000 = $45
Interstitial: 15,000 × $6 / 1000 = $90
Rewarded (20% watch): 3,000 × $15 / 1000 = $45
TOTAL: $180/month
```

36,000 × $5 CPM / 1000 = $180/month
```

---

### ClueScale (Strategic Guessing)

---

## Part 6: Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Sign Up for Ad Network (30 min)

**Google AdSense:**
1. Go to https://www.google.com/adsense
2. Sign up with Google account
3. Add website URL (gamebuddies.io)
4. Wait for approval (1-3 days)
5. Get ad unit code

### Step 2: Add Ad Code to Games (1-2 hours)

**Banner Ad Example (React):**
```jsx
// components/BannerAd.tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

export const BannerAd: React.FC = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Load AdSense script
    try {
      (window.adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('Ad error:', e);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="ad-container">
      <ins
        className="adsbygoogle"
        style={{ display: 'block' }}
        data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        data-ad-slot="1234567890"
        data-ad-format="auto"
        data-full-width-responsive="true"
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Interstitial Ad Example:**
```jsx
// components/InterstitialAd.tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export const InterstitialAd: React.FC<{ onClose: () => void }> = ({ onClose }) => {
  const [countdown, setCountdown] = useState(5);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      setCountdown((prev) => {
        if (prev <= 1) {
          clearInterval(timer);
          return 0;
        }
        return prev - 1;
      });
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="interstitial-overlay">
      <div className="interstitial-content">
        <div className="ad-container">
          {/* AdSense interstitial ad code */}
          <ins
            className="adsbygoogle"
            style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', height: '250px' }}
            data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
            data-ad-slot="9876543210"
          />
        </div>

        {countdown > 0 ? (
          <p className="countdown">Continuing in {countdown}...</p>
        ) : (
          <button onClick={onClose} className="close-button">
            Continue to Game
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Rewarded Video Ad Example:**
```jsx
// components/RewardedAd.tsx
import React from 'react';

export const RewardedAd: React.FC<{ onReward: () => void }> = ({ onReward }) => {
  const handleWatchAd = () => {
    // Show rewarded video ad
    if (window.adsbygoogle) {
      // AdSense doesn't support rewarded videos natively
      // Use AdMob or other network for rewarded videos

      // For now, simulate with interstitial
      // TODO: Integrate AdMob rewarded video SDK

      // After ad completes, trigger reward
      setTimeout(() => {
        onReward();
      }, 5000);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="rewarded-ad-button">
      <button onClick={handleWatchAd} className="watch-ad-button">
        🎬 Watch Ad for Free Cosmetic
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Step 3: Add Ad Placements to Each Game

**BingoBuddies Example:**
```jsx
// pages/GamePage.tsx
import { BannerAd } from '../components/BannerAd';
import { InterstitialAd } from '../components/InterstitialAd';

const GamePage = () => {
  const [showInterstitial, setShowInterstitial] = useState(false);

  // Show interstitial after game ends
  const handleGameEnd = () => {
    setShowInterstitial(true);
  };

  return (
    <div className="game-page">
      {/* Banner ad in lobby */}
      {gameState === 'lobby' && <BannerAd />}

      {/* Game content */}
      <GameContent onGameEnd={handleGameEnd} />

      {/* Interstitial ad after game */}
      {showInterstitial && (
        <InterstitialAd onClose={() => setShowInterstitial(false)} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Part 7: Comparison: Ads vs Premium Cosmetics

### Revenue Comparison (500 Active Users)

| Monetization | Setup | Revenue | User Impact |
|-------------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Ads Only** | Easy (1-2 hours) | $700-1,800/month | Some annoyance |
| **Premium Only** | Hard (20-40 hours) | $500-2,500/month | Zero annoyance (optional) |
| **Both (Hybrid)** | Medium (25-45 hours) | $1,200-4,000/month | Choice: watch ads or buy premium |

### Pros & Cons

**Ads:**
- ✅ Easier to implement (2-3 hours)
- ✅ Revenue from ALL users
- ✅ No payment processing (AdSense handles it)
- ❌ Annoys some players
- ❌ AdBlocker reduces revenue (~30% of users)
- ❌ CPM varies wildly by geography

**Premium Cosmetics:**
- ✅ Zero annoyance (optional)
- ✅ Players who pay WANT to support you
- ✅ More sustainable long-term
- ❌ Harder to implement (20-40 hours)
- ❌ Revenue from only 5-15% of users
- ❌ Need payment processing (Stripe fees)

**Hybrid (Best of Both):**
- ✅ Maximize revenue from all users
- ✅ Players choose: watch ads (free) or buy premium (ad-free)
- ✅ Respects player choice
- ❌ More complex to implement
- ❌ Need to coordinate ad + payment systems

---

## Part 8: Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Model

### The Best Approach

**Offer TWO options:**

**Option 1: Free with Ads**
- Play any game for free
- See 2-3 non-intrusive ads per session
- Ads at natural break points only
- Optional rewarded videos for bonuses

**Option 2: Premium (Ad-Free + Cosmetics)**
- $2-5/month per game
- Zero ads
- Exclusive cosmetics
- Support development

### Why This Works

**Psychology:**
- Players appreciate having a choice
- "Ad-supported free" is common in mobile games
- Premium feels like a BONUS (ad-removal + cosmetics) not a tax
- Players who can't afford premium still enjoy the game

**Revenue:**
- 70% of users watch ads → $500-1,000/month
- 10% of users buy premium → $500-1,000/month
- **Total: $1,000-2,000/month at 500 DAU**

### Implementation

**Add this to your pricing page:**
```
FREE TIER:
✅ Play any game unlimited
✅ Create custom content
✅ Voice chat
✅ Join any room
⚠️ Shows 2-3 ads per session (at natural breaks)

PREMIUM ($4.99/month):
✅ All free features
✅ ZERO ADS (completely ad-free)
✅ 50+ exclusive cosmetics
✅ Premium badge
✅ Monthly cosmetic packs
```

---

## Part 9: User Experience Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Show countdown before ads**
   - "Ad in 3...2...1..."
   - Gives player warning

2. **Make ads skippable**
   - 5-second skip button
   - Players feel in control

3. **Place ads at natural breaks**
   - After round ends
   - In lobby waiting
   - Between games

4. **Frequency cap**
   - Max 3-4 ads per session
   - 1 ad every 5-10 minutes

5. **Offer ad-free option**
   - Premium subscription removes ads
   - Players appreciate choice

6. **Test with friends**
   - Get feedback before launch
   - Adjust placement based on feedback

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Never interrupt gameplay**
   - No mid-game popups
   - No ads covering controls

2. **Don't force unskippable long videos**
   - Max 5 seconds before skip
   - 15-30 second videos ok if skippable

3. **Don't show too many ads**
   - 5+ ads = players quit
   - Respect player time

4. **Don't use misleading ads**
   - No "fake close" buttons
   - No malicious ad networks

5. **Don't place ads over content**
   - No banner covering game UI
   - Keep ads in designated zones

6. **Don't make ads mandatory for features**
   - Rewarded videos = optional only
   - Never lock gameplay behind ads

---

## Part 10: Testing & Optimization

### Week 1: Launch with Minimal Ads
```
Start with:
- 1 banner ad (lobby only)
- Test for 1 week
- Measure: Drop-off rate, player feedback
```

### Week 2: Add Interstitial
```
Add:
- 1 interstitial ad (after game ends)
- Test for 1 week
- Measure: Revenue vs player retention
```

### Week 3: Add Optional Rewarded Video
```
Add:
- 1 optional rewarded video button
- Test for 1 week
- Measure: Click-through rate, revenue
```

### Week 4: Optimize Placement
```
Adjust based on data:
- If revenue low → increase frequency slightly
- If retention drops → reduce frequency
- If players complain → adjust timing/placement
```

### Key Metrics to Track

**Revenue:**
- CPM (aim for $5+)
- RPM (Revenue per 1000 visits)
- Daily ad revenue
- Total monthly revenue

**User Experience:**
- Session length (did ads reduce it?)
- Return rate (do players come back?)
- Drop-off rate (when do players quit?)
- Feedback (what do players say?)

**Optimization:**
- Ad viewability rate (are ads seen?)
- Click-through rate (are ads clicked?)
- Fill rate (how often ads load?)
- AdBlocker rate (how many block ads?)

---

## Part 11: Cost Analysis

### Ad Network Costs

**Google AdSense:**
- **Setup:** Free

- **Payment threshold:** $5

### Net Revenue Example

**Scenario: $1,000 gross ad revenue/month**
```
Google AdSense:
$1,000 × 70% = $700 net to you
Google keeps: $300

PropellerAds:
$1,000 × 85% = $850 net to you
PropellerAds keeps: $150

Render.com hosting: -$7
Domain: -$1.25
Other tools: -$10

NET PROFIT: $680-840/month
```
