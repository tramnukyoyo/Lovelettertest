## Pricing Structure

### Free Tier (100% Playable)
```
✅ All 5 games unlimited play
✅ 20-30 base questions per game
✅ Join/create rooms
✅ Voice chat & video features
✅ Custom content creation (limited)
⚠️ Shows 2-3 ads per session (at natural breaks)
```

### Question Packs - €0.99 each (À La Carte)
```
✅ 50-200 questions/categories/templates per pack
✅ One-time purchase, keep forever
✅ No subscription required
✅ Examples:
   - "Comedy Questions" pack
   - "Disney Movies" categories
   - "Holiday Bingo" templates
```

**Why €0.99 works:**
- Low friction ("that's basically free")
- Impulse buy territory
- High conversion (35-50% of users buy at least 1 pack)
- Volume strategy: 1000 users × 2 packs = €2,000 vs 100 users × 1 pack at €4.99 = €499

### Premium Monthly - €4.99/month
```
✅ ALL question/category/template packs
✅ Ad-free experience across all games
✅ Unlimited custom content creation
✅ New pack added every month
✅ Early access to features
✅ Supporter badge
✅ Priority support
✅ Cancel anytime
```

### Premium Lifetime - €19.99 one-time
```
✅ Ad-free FOREVER
✅ All CURRENT packs (at time of purchase)
✅ Supporter badge
✅ One-time payment
❌ Does NOT include future packs
   (this incentivizes monthly for long-term users)
```

**Psychology:** Lifetime captures price-sensitive players who would never subscribe monthly. They see €19.99 vs €4.99/month and think "that's 4 months free!" but don't realize committed players stay 12+ months.

## TikTok/YouTube Growth Strategy

### Content Farming from Streamers

**The Process:**

**Step 1: Get Permission**
- Add to Creator Agreement: "We can use clips from your streams"
- Pay bonus: €10-50 per clip if it goes viral (100K+ views)
- Most streamers happy to agree (free promotion for them)

**Step 2: Create Clips**
```
From each 2-hour stream, extract:
- 5-10 funny moments (15-60 seconds each)
- 2-3 epic wins/fails
- 1-2 educational/tips clips

10-15 clips per stream
4 streams per week = 40-60 clips/week
= 160-240 clips/month
```

**Step 3: Post to TikTok/YouTube**
```
Post schedule:
- TikTok: 3-5 clips per day
- YouTube Shorts: 2-3 clips per day
- Instagram Reels: 1-2 clips per day

Monthly output: 200-300 clips across platforms
```

**Step 4: Optimize for Virality**
```
Hook (first 3 seconds):
- "Bet you can't answer this"
- "This streamer got destroyed"
- "Watch what happens next"

Content (7-30 seconds):
- Funny moment
- Epic fail
- Surprising answer
- Streamer reaction

CTA (last 2 seconds):
- "Play now → link in bio"
- "Join 40K+ players"
- Text overlay with URL
```
